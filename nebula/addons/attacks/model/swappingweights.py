class SwappingWeightsAttack(ModelAttack):
    """
    Implements a swapping weights attack on the received model weights.

    This attack performs stochastic swapping of weights in a specified layer of the model,
    potentially disrupting its performance. The attack is not deterministic, and its performance
    can vary. The code may not work as expected for some layers due to reshaping, and its
    computational cost scales quadratically with the layer size. It should not be applied to
    the last layer, as it would make the attack detectable due to high loss on the malicious node.

        engine (object): The training engine object that manages the aggregator.
        attack_params (dict): Parameters for the attack, including:
            - layer_idx (int): The index of the layer where the weights will be swapped.

        Performs the swapping weights attack by computing a similarity matrix and

        in a way that could potentially disrupt the training process. The attack also
